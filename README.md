# Bigfoot Sightings Data Analysis

## Objective

This assignment focuses on analyzing Bigfoot sighting reports using Python's data analysis libraries. The primary goals are:

- To load and explore the Bigfoot sightings dataset using the pandas library
- To perform basic data analysis and derive insights from the Bigfoot sighting reports
- To create visualizations using matplotlib for data interpretation
- To document findings and observations from the analysis

## Dataset

This project uses the `bigfoot.csv` dataset, which contains documented reports of Bigfoot sightings across North America. The dataset includes various attributes such as:

- Sighting dates and times
- Geographical information (state, county, latitude, longitude)
- Environmental conditions (weather, temperature)
- Sighting details (classification, observed behaviors)
- Report sources and credibility assessment

## Submission Requirements

Please submit a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) containing the following components:

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Code to load the Bigfoot dataset into a pandas DataFrame
- Initial exploration of the dataset structure and contents
- Examination of basic statistics and information about the data

### 2. Basic Data Analysis
- Data cleaning and preprocessing steps specific to the Bigfoot dataset
- Calculation of relevant statistics and metrics about sighting patterns
- Temporal analysis of sightings (by year, season, time of day)
- Geographical analysis of sightings (by state, region)

### 3. Visualizations
- Creation of appropriate plots and charts using matplotlib including:
  - Time series of sightings over years
  - Geographical distribution of sightings (by state/region)
  - Seasonal patterns in sightings
  - Common environmental conditions during sightings
- Proper labeling of all visualizations (titles, axis labels, legends)

### 4. Findings and Observations
- Summary of key insights discovered during analysis
- Interpretation of visualizations and what they reveal about Bigfoot sightings
- Interesting patterns or correlations in the data
- Conclusions drawn from the analytical process

## Technical Requirements

- Use Python 3.x
- Utilize pandas for data manipulation
- Employ matplotlib for data visualization
- Include both code and markdown cells for clear documentation
- Ensure all code executes without errors

## Analysis Approach

The analysis will follow these key steps:

1. Load and inspect the Bigfoot sightings data
2. Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, format dates, etc.)
3. Explore temporal patterns in sightings
4. Analyze geographical distribution of reports
5. Examine environmental factors associated with sightings
6. Visualize key findings
7. Document insights and conclusions

## Evaluation Criteria

Submissions will be evaluated based on:
- Correct implementation of data loading and analysis
- Appropriate use of pandas functions and methods
- Quality and relevance of visualizations to the Bigfoot dataset
- Clarity of findings and observations specific to Bigfoot sightings
- Code organization and documentation

## Potential Research Questions

- Which states have the most Bigfoot sightings?
- Has the frequency of sightings changed over time?
- Are there seasonal patterns to Bigfoot sightings?
- What environmental conditions are most commonly associated with sightings?
- How have reporting methods changed over time?
